Hey bro. Id recommend updating your branch to cm10-.1, because right now, your branch is at gingerbread, which will cause
build errors for those trying to sync your stuff.

Also, could you add me to your member list? Id like to upload alot of Cyanogenmods stuff for you

Lastly, ill try and be as active on here as possible. :)
